This is Simulator I, a component of the end-to-end simulation that is currently in development for the Green Bank/BYU/WVU Beamformer project.
It is a plugin for the hashpipe parallel processing pipeline.
More information on hashpipe can be found here: https://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/PAPER_Correlator_Manifest#HASHPIPE

It is still in development, but it should build in its current state.

When you build this plugin, make sure that you are installing your plugin to the hashpipe installation directory.
For example, I installed hashpipe to "/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall" using "./configure --prefix=/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall".
So, when I install the fake_gpu plugin, I will also install it to /home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall.
I will use $INSTALLDIR to refer to the hashpipe installation directory.

To build:

From the root of FLAG-Beamformer-Simulator-I:

    $ mkdir build config
    $ autoreconf -is
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure --prefix=$INSTALLDIR --with-hashpipe=$INSTALLDIR
    $ make
    $ make install

To run:

$ taskset 0x0606 hashpipe -p fake_gpu -I 0 -o BINDHOST=$YOURHOST -o GPUDEV=0 -o XID=0 -c 3 fake_gpu_thread -c 2 fake_gpu_test_thread
