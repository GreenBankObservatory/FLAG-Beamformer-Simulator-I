This is Simulator I, a component of the end-to-end simulation that is currently in development for the Green Bank/BYU/WVU Beamformer project.
It is a plugin for the hashpipe parallel processing pipeline.
More information on hashpipe can be found here: https://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/PAPER_Correlator_Manifest#HASHPIPE

It is still in development, but it should build in its current state.

When you build this plugin, make sure that you are installing your plugin to the hashpipe installation directory.
For example, I installed hashpipe to "/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall" using "./configure --prefix=/home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall".
So, when I install the fake_gpu plugin, I will also install it to /home/sandboxes/tchamber/paper/commoninstall.
I will use $HASHDIR to refer to this common installation directory.

You will also need to run the vegasFitsWriter. It can be found in /home/sandboxes/tchamber/vegas_devel3/vegas_devel/src/dibas_fits_writer. This directory will be referred to as $VEGASDIR.

fits_writer_thread has been deprecated and is awaiting removal.

vegasFitsWriter is replacing it, but we don't have a publically available repo for it yet, so right now there's now way for non-GB folks to run this. Sorry about that :(

To build:
    From the root of FLAG-Beamformer-Simulator-I (henceforth $SIM1):
        $ mkdir build config
        $ autoreconf -is
        $ cd build
        $ ../configure --prefix=$HASHDIR --with-hashpipe=$HASHDIR
        $ make
        $ make install

To run a scan (RECOMMENDED):
    Now you can simply run the run_scan script and pass it arguments to set the scan start time and length. For example, to run a scan in 1 minute for 10 seconds:
        $ $SIM1/scripts/run_scan.sh --startin 60 --scanlength 10
    To run a scan at a specific time (e.g. May 13 2015 at 12:00 exactly):
        $ $SIM1/scripts/run_scan.sh --starttime 15:05:13:12:00:00 --scanlength 10

To run/start a scan (MANUALLY):
    After setting your PATH to point to $HASHDIR:
        $ taskset 0x0606 hashpipe -p fake_gpu -I 0 -o BINDHOST=px1-2.gb.nrao.edu -o GPUDEV=0 -o XID=0 -c 3 fake_gpu_thread
		# start

	Now run the set_status script (this will set some necessary status memory key values):
		$ $SIM1/scripts/set_status.sh
		
	In another terminal (remember to set the PATH here, too):
		$ $VEGASDIR/vegasFitsWriter
		# start

	The scan should run and output to the directory specified in the DATADIR status key (set in the script above, but feel free to change it).

Notes:
    Be sure to write your fits files to a local disk
